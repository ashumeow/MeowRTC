This is a basic webrtc audio demo in Dart. <br>
I can not share my remote connection address. I am open, but not so open. <br>
Run it via Dart. <br> <br>
Don't have Dart, eh? <br>
Don't worry... Here are the following steps:- <br>
<b>Step 1: </b>Download Dart -- <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html">click here</a> <br>
<b>Step 2: </b>Download latest JRE -- <a href="https://jdk8.java.net/download.html">click here</a> <br>
<b>Step 3: </b>Make sure to keep JRE inside Dart folder... Here is how i placed it:- <br>
<code>D:\dart1.8.5\dart\jre</code>
<br>
<b>Step 4: </b>Dart Editor is launched. <br>
<code>File --> create new project </code> <br>
Enter project name is <code>meowrtc_audio</code> if you want to exactly run this demo. If you keep someother name, then make sure to modify the path/file names.
<br>
<b>Step 5: </b>About running it:- <br>
There are two ways of doing it... <br>
1. <code>Run --> Show Web Server Address</code> <br>
The address will be displayed in <code>Tools Output</code>. Just copy it and paste it in Chrome browser. <br>
After clicking enter, you will asked for the permission. Click allow. Duh! Here you go with the output. <br>
Advantage:- You can share that link to any buddies and they can also view it after you allow them to access. <br>
<code>Note:- Don't close your dart editor while sharing the link for someone to access to link. If the editor is closed, then that person will get a blank page or page not displayed. </code> <br>
(OR) <br>
2. You can also run from local host: <br>
Before doing it.. <code>To start Chrome with remote connections enabled, use the --remote-debugging-port=<port> command-line flag. </code>
<br> Now...Start it... --- <code>Run --> Remote Connection</code>
<br><br>
Now, we are done! (^_^)
