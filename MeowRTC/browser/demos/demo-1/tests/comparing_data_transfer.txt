Comparisons

Websites with WebRTC:-
File Size = Convert to KB
Upload time = (0.1 X 2) for 1MB, (0.2 X 2) for 2MB, etc..
Data transmission time = webpage loading time
Data transfer rate = File size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds)

Other sites without WebRTC:-
File Size = Convert to KB
Upload time = File size X 2 (in minutes)
Data transmission time = webpage loading time
Data transfer rate = File size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds)

Conclusion:-
Websites (with WebRTC performance) > Websites (without WebRTC performance)
