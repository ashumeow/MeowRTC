----- COMPARISONS -----

(1) FOR POOR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY

(2) FOR SLOW NETWORK CONNECTIVITY (Eg: 2G, 2.5G, 2.75G)

Websites with WebRTC:-
File Size = Convert to KB
Upload time (2.75G) = (0.1 sec X 2.5) for 1MB, (0.2 sec X 2.5) for 2MB, etc..
Upload time (2.5G) = (0.1 sec X 2.75) for 1MB, (0.2 sec X 2.75) for 2MB, etc..
Upload time (2G) = (0.1 sec X 3) for 1MB, (0.2 sec X 3) for 2MB, etc..
Data transmission time = webpage loading time
Data transfer rate (KB/s) = File size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds)

Other sites without WebRTC:-
File Size = Convert to KB
Upload time (2.75G) = File size X 2.5 (in minutes) (=> convert mins to secs)
Upload time (2.5G) = File size X 2.75 (in minutes) (=> convert mins to secs)
Upload time (2G) = File size X 3 (in minutes) (=> mins to secs)
Data transmission time = webpage loading time
Data transfer rate (KB/s) = File size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds)


(3) FOR AVERAGE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY (Eg: 3G)

Websites with WebRTC:-
File Size = Convert to KB
Upload time = (0.1 sec X 2) for 1MB, (0.2 sec X 2) for 2MB, etc..
Data transmission time = webpage loading time
Data transfer rate (KB/s) = File size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds)

Other sites without WebRTC:-
File Size = Convert to KB
Upload time (For mobile) = File size X 2 (in minutes) (=> convert mins to secs)
Upload time (For desktop/Laptop) = File size X 1 (in minutes) (=> convert mins to secs)
Data transmission time = webpage loading time
Data transfer rate (KB/s) = File size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds)

(4) FOR HIGH SPEED CONNECTIVITY (Eg. 4G)

(5) FOR WIFI

(6) FOR ETHERNET

Conclusion:-
Websites (with WebRTC performance) > Websites (without WebRTC performance)
