First Byte Time 	
Applicable Objects 	
Time to First Byte for the page (back-end processing + redirects)
What is checked 	
The target time is the time needed for the DNS, socket and SSL negotiations + 100ms. A single letter grade will be deducted for every 100ms beyond the target.
Keep-Alive 	
Applicable Objects 	
All objects that are from a domain that serves more than one object for the page (i.e. if only a single object is served from a given domain it will not be checked)
What is checked 	
The response header contains a "keep-alive" directive or the same socket was used for more than one object from the given host
GZIP Text 	
Applicable Objects 	
All objects with a mime type of "text/*" or "*javascript*"
What is checked 	
Transfer-encoding is checked to see if it is gzip. If it is not then the file is compressed and the percentage of compression is the result (so a page that can save 30% of the size of it's text by compressing would yield a 70% test result)
