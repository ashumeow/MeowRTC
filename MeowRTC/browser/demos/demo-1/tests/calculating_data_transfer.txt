HOW-TO-DO??

To get KB/s --
Step 1:-
We must first convert Mega Bytes to KiloBytes. 
1MB = 1024 KB
Example:- 25MB = 25600KB

Step 2:- 
Convert minutes into seconds.
Time taken to transfer 25 MB = 2 minutes = 2X60 = 120 seconds

Step 3:-
Divide Kilo Bytes by Seconds to get the rate:
25,600/120=213.34
We'll round it too 213
So now we have a rate of 213 KB/s.
