HOW-TO-DO??

EXAMPLE:-

(1) For transferring a normal which has no WebRTC enabled with high-speed internet connection (Let's say 4G)

To get KB/s --
Step 1:-
We must first convert Mega Bytes to KiloBytes. 
1MB = 1024 KB
Example:- 25MB = 25600KB

Step 2:- 
Convert minutes into seconds.
Time taken to transfer 25 MB = 2 minutes = 2X60 = 120 seconds

Step 3:-
Divide Kilo Bytes by Seconds to get the rate:
25,600/120=213.34
We'll round it too 213
So now we have a rate of 213 KB/s.

(2) Using WebRTC

[MeowRTC]
meowrtc 
2MB file= 2048KB
time for upload = 0.25 sec
time for data transfer = 1 sec (for all file size)
Upload rate = 8192 KB/sec = 8MB/sec
Data transfer rate = 2MB/sec
