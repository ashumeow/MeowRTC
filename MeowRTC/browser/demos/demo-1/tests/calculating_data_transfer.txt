HOW-TO-DO??

Example...
2MB file= 2048KB
time for upload = 0.2 sec
time for data transmission (sending/receiving) time = 1 sec (for all file size)
Data transfer rate = file size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds) 
			= 2048 / 1 + 0.2
			= 2048 / 1.2
			= 1706.67 KB/sec => 1.67 MB/sec
For sending a 2MB file, it takes 1.67 MB/sec.

As file size increases, the data transfer rate increase for maintaining the same better performance rate.

Here is another example:-
3MB file= 3072KB
time for upload = 0.30 sec
time for data transmission (sending/receiving) time = 1 sec (for all file size)
Data transfer rate = file size (in KB) / data transmission time (in seconds) + uploading time (in seconds) 
			= 3072 / 1 + 0.30
			= 3072 / 1.30
			= 2363.1 KB/sec => 2.31 MB/sec
For sending a 3MB file, it takes 2.31MB/sec.
